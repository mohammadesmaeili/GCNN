### Semi-Supervised Node Classification by Graph Convolutional Networks and Extracted Side Information
# Abstract
The nodes of a graph existing in a cluster are more likely to connect to each other than with other nodes in the graph. Then revealing some information about some nodes, the structure of the graph (graph edges) provides this opportunity to know more information about other nodes. From this perspective, this paper revisits the node classification task in a semi-supervised scenario by graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The goal is to benefit from the flow of information that circulates around the revealed node labels. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, this paper provides a method for extracting side information from a graph realization. Then a new GCN architecture is presented that combines the output of traditional GCN and the extracted side information. Another contribution of this paper is relevant to non-graph observations (independent side information) that exists beside a graph realization in many applications. Indeed, the extracted side information can be replaced by a sequence of side information that is independent of the graph structure. For both cases, the experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a higher prediction accuracy in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods for the node classification task.
